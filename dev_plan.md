# FreelanceFlow Development Plan

## Project Overview

FreelanceFlow is a lightweight SaaS for solo freelancers centered around getting paid. The application streamlines client management, deal tracking, invoicing, and cash flow monitoring in a single-page app with minimal operational overhead.

### Core Value Proposition
- **Focused on payment management**: Track deals → Generate invoices → Get paid
- **Low maintenance**: Self-hosted with minimal ops overhead
- **Single-page simplicity**: Everything accessible without complex navigation
- **Mobile-friendly**: Work from anywhere on any device
- **Frictionless experience**: Sign in with Google, intuitive UI, zero learning curve

## MVP Definition & Success Metrics
- Minimal feature set for an initial release:
  - Client CRUD
  - 3-stage Kanban deals
  - One-off invoices with PDF & Stripe link
  - Dashboard stat cards
  - **CSV export** of invoices, clients, and deals for local record-keeping
- Definition of Done:
  - Users can onboard, add a client, move a deal, create an invoice, and obtain a payment link without errors.
- Key Metrics (OKRs):
  - Time to first invoice < 5min
  - CSV import success rate > 95%
  - User retention (week 2) ≥ 30%

For production, use the `.env.production.template` file which is configured for Neon PostgreSQL and Render deployment.

### Running the Application
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Start the server: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
3. Access the application at http://localhost:8000

### Deployment
The application is configured for deployment on Render using the `render.yaml` configuration file. The database is hosted on Neon PostgreSQL.

### Next Steps for Sprint 2
